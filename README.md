This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data Class at CMU

# About Me
My name is Ernest Rajakone and I identify using the prnouns he/him/his. This portfolio is part of my coursework for the Telling Stories with Data Class at CMU, my final course before graduating from the Master of Public Management Program at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. I currently work for the City of Pittsburgh in the Office of Community Affairs, following previous stints at Planned Parenthood and on local campaigns. Following graduation, I hope to continue working in local government.

I've lived in Pittsburgh since 2011, when I moved here to attend the University of Pittsburgh. While at Pitt, I majored in Political Science and minored in History, and was very involved on campus. Moving to Pittsburgh was a formative experience for me and I'm grateful for the diversity in experiences I've gained in calling this city home. My family are Sri Lankan Tamils who left the island during the nation's civil war, and despite being born in the Bronx, I lived most of my life in rural America. Before Pittsburgh, I most recently lived in Central Pennsylvania. 

# What I Hope to Learn
From this course, I hope to learn how to effectively utilize data to inform initiatives and shape policy in local government. Due to my professional life, this knowledge would be practically useful. In particular, I hope this course is able to provide me with a skillset to create effective visualizations of data. But most importantly, I hope this course provides me with an increased understanding on how to analyze data that is presented to me and effectively create narratives around data available to me.

Here is where all my data visualizations will go.
